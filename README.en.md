| Player                    | OSD | issue                                     |
| ------------------------- | --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [netease-cloud-music-gtk] | X   | gives 0 position                          |
| Firefox                   | X   | do not provide position call              |
| qqmusic                   | O   | no info other than title/artist avaliable |
| [flutter-netease-music]   | X   | no mpris support                          |

## Directories

Typically,

```
~/.cache/waylyrics/XX/...
~/.config/waylyrics/...
# waylyrics will first try load theme here, if not exists, load from global template.
~/.local/share/waylyrics/_themes/...
```

## Approach

Current approach my seems dirty:

1. get the likely actived player when none is connnected, and disconnect from one only if it's not avaliable more
2. keep sync with 2s interval and 20ms refresh for lyrics
3. use the length-matched result (or first result if former is not found) of `search_song` and sync START in each run, fetch lyric only when needed

[YesPlayMusicOSD] have great lyrics support

BruceZhang1993's [lyricsSeeker](https://github.com/BruceZhang1993/LyricsSeeker) is still WIP, but it may have better-looking and better integration with KDE.

Copay's [caraoke-plasmoid](https://github.com/Copay/caraoke-plasmoid) is currently Plasma-only, though it is easy to remove plasmoid components
